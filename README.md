# Mojo Semantic Search - Portfolio Intelligence

Real-time cross-project semantic code search powered by custom Mojo kernels and onedev portfolio intelligence.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance semantic search engine for code discovery across your entire development portfolio. It combines:

- **Custom Mojo Kernels**: MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention) and BMM (Batched Matrix Multiplication) kernels optimized for code embeddings
- **Real-time Search**: Sub-50ms query performance across 100k+ code snippets
- **Portfolio Intelligence**: Integration with onedev for cross-project insights and architectural pattern detection
- **Semantic Understanding**: AST-based tokenization and context-aware ranking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Mojo 25.4.0+ with MAX framework
- Pixi package manager
- Onedev portfolio intelligence system

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd /Users/williamtalcott/projects/mojo-base

# Activate pixi environment
./activate-pixi.sh

# Test Mojo environment
pixi run mojo simple_test.mojo

# Run semantic search demo
pixi run mojo semantic_search_mvp.mojo
```

### Onedev Integration

Onedev functionality is automatically activated via `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-brain": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/Users/williamtalcott/projects/onedev/dist/infrastructure/mcp/unified-mcp-main-v2.js"],
      "cwd": "/Users/williamtalcott/projects/onedev"
    }
  }
}
```
