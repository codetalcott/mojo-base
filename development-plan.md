# Mojo Semantic Search Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Kernels (Hours 1-4)

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [x] Activate onedev functionality in mojo-base
- [x] Set up vector database using onedev
- [ ] Initialize Mojo development environment
- [ ] Create project structure

### 1.2 Core Mojo Kernels
- [ ] Implement MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention) Kernel
  - 8 heads, 768 embedding dimension  
  - Optimized for code sequences (max 512 tokens)
  - Custom attention patterns for code syntax
  - Target: 10x faster than PyTorch equivalent

- [ ] Implement BMM (Batched Matrix Multiplication) Kernel
  - Single query vs N corpus embeddings
  - SIMD-accelerated cosine similarity
  - Target: Sub-millisecond search across 100k+ snippets

### 1.3 Data Structures
- [ ] CodeSnippet struct with metadata
- [ ] SearchResult struct with scoring
- [ ] SemanticSearchEngine main coordinator

## Phase 2: Search Engine Implementation (Hours 5-12)

### 2.1 Code Preprocessing Pipeline
- [ ] AST-based tokenization using Tree-sitter
- [ ] Function/class extraction with context
- [ ] Semantic chunking for logical code blocks
- [ ] Metadata attachment (file path, project, dependencies)

### 2.2 Real-Time Search Engine
- [ ] Query embedding generation
- [ ] Corpus embedding storage and retrieval
- [ ] Similarity computation and ranking
- [ ] Integration with onedev vector database

### 2.3 Onedev Integration
- [ ] Use onedev MCP tools for context assembly
- [ ] Portfolio project scanning and indexing
- [ ] Vector similarity insights
- [ ] Architectural pattern detection

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization (Hours 13-20)

### 3.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] SIMD vectorization for embeddings
- [ ] Parallel processing with `parallelize`
- [ ] Memory tiling for GPU acceleration
- [ ] Autotuned parameter optimization

### 3.2 Multi-Modal Search
- [ ] Code + comments semantic understanding
- [ ] API usage pattern detection
- [ ] Cross-language semantic bridges
- [ ] Architectural pattern matching

### 3.3 Integration & Interface
- [ ] Simple web interface for search
- [ ] CLI tool for terminal-based search
- [ ] Real-time search-as-you-type
- [ ] VSCode extension integration

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Embedding Speed**: < 10ms per code snippet
- **Search Speed**: < 5ms for similarity across 100k snippets  
- **Accuracy**: > 80% relevant results in top 10
- **Real-time**: Search-as-you-type with < 50ms latency

### Technical Goals
